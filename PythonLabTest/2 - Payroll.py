'''
The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file. The format of each line of the file is
the following:

<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>

Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the
given period. The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header.

Each line should contain:
An employee’s name
The hours worked
The wages paid for that period.

An example of the program input and output is shown below:
Enter the file name: data.txt
Name            Hours      Total Pay
Lambert            34         357.00
Osborne            22         137.50
Giacometti          5         503.50
