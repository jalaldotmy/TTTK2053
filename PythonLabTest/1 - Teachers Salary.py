Teachers in most school districts are paid on a schedule that provides a 
salary based on their number of years of teaching experience. For example,
a beginning teacher in the Lexington School District might be paid
$30,000 the first year. For each year of experience after this first year, up
to 10 years, the teacher receives a 2% increase over the preceding value.
Write a program that displays a salary schedule, in tabular format, for
teachers in a school district. The inputs are the starting salary, the percentage
increase, and the number of years in the schedule. Each row in
the schedule should contain the year number and the salary for that year.
